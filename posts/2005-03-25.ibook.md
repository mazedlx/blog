                <p>Today Sandra and me visited the local apple store, where she will buy her 14&quot; iBook next week :-) Her first apple ever (and mine too :-)).
If I'd had 2700 euro I'd buy a 17&quot; powerbook for myself. Apple is such a great company <a href="http://www.apple.com"><a href="http://www.apple.com">http://www.apple.com</a></a></p>
